I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at University of Washington.

My dissertation examines how business interests—specifically at a firm level—shape elite preferences on free trade, focusing on U.S.-China trade relations over the recent three decades. Broadly, I am interested in how the conflict and confluence of domestic interests (e.g., business, labor, human rights groups) shape foreign economic policymaking (e.g., trade and industrial policies). My research is supported by the American Political Science Association's [Doctoral Dissertation Research Grant](https://apsanet.org/programs/doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grants/) and the Smith Richardson Foundation's [World Politics and Statecraft Fellowship](https://www.srf.org/programs/international-security-foreign-policy/world-politics-statecraft-fellowship/).

I am also interested in applied statistics, causal inference, and computational methods, particularly the application of text-as-data/NLP in political science. At UW, I serve as a Statistical Consultant at the Center for Social Science Computation and Research ([CSSCR](https://depts.washington.edu/csscr/)) and was selected as a Data Science for Social Good ([DSSG](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/data-science-for-social-good/)) Fellow at eScience Institute.

Outside of academia, I am a nonprofit leader and democracy advocate for Hong Kong. I received a B.Soc.Sc. and a LL.B. from University of Hong Kong in 2017.
