I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Washington (UW).

My dissertation examines how business interests—specifically at the firm level—shape elite preferences on free trade, with a focus on U.S.-China trade relations over the past three decades. More broadly, I am interested in how the conflict and confluence of domestic interests (e.g., business, labor, and human rights groups) shape foreign economic policymaking, including trade and industrial policies.

My research is supported by the American Political Science Association's [Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant](https://apsanet.org/programs/doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grants/) and the Smith Richardson Foundation's [World Politics and Statecraft Fellowship](https://www.srf.org/programs/international-security-foreign-policy/world-politics-statecraft-fellowship/).

I have a strong interest in applied statistics, causal inference, and computational methods, particularly the application of text-as-data/NLP in political science. At UW, I serve as a Consultant at the Center for Social Science Computation and Research ([CSSCR](https://depts.washington.edu/csscr/)) and was selected as a Data Science for Social Good ([DSSG](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/data-science-for-social-good/)) Fellow at eScience Institute.

Outside of academia, I am a nonprofit leader and democracy advocate for Hong Kong. I testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the city's democracy and rule of law. I received a B.Soc.Sc. and an LL.B. from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in 2017.
