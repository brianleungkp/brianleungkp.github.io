I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at University of Washington. 

My dissertation examines how business interests – specifically at a firm level – shape politicians’ preferences on free trade, focusing on the past three decades of U.S.-China trade relations. My research is supported by APSA Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDRIG).

I am also interested in applied statistics and computational methods, particularly the application of text-as-data/NLP in political science. At Washington, I serve as a Statistical Consultant at the Center for Social Science Computation and Research (CSSCR) and was selected a Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) Fellow at eScience Institute. 

Beyond academia, I received a B.Soc.Sc. and a L.L.B. from University of Hong Kong.
